# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: May 10th, 2020

**Initial Goals:** I already can code in some capacity in Python, R, Matlab and C++ but not as strongly as I would like. I have undertaken a BSc Physics, MSc Data Science and am currently undergoing a PhD where I have learned scientific programming to the point where I can implement mathematical models, produce data analysis and visualisations and basic machine learning. I have little to no experience in html, css or js other than some brief skills I learned developing a personal website.
My goals therefore are:

- To improve my scientific programming skills by exploring new methods and problem solving
- To learn basic html/css/js skills through web development

I will host or link everything I do both in this github repository, on twitter @MaxxSci, and on my website I build over the last few days below!

### Day 1: May 11th, 2020

**Aim:** Solving Project Euler problems in Python with detailed explanations, and producing a blog post on my website with those explanations and links to the solutions. This will improve my Python, HTML, and Jekyll skills - as well as flexing my mathematical muscles and markdown skills!

**Thoughts:** The problems were a lot of fun and I managed to complete three in a reasonable amount of time. Thinking of efficient ways of solving the problems was interesting, and I'd like to do more of these problems in the future.
